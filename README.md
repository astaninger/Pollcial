Introduction: 
Pollcial is a social polling mobile application for Android using Firebase as our backend. It allows users with accounts or guests to crowdsource answers for simple decisions that they are trying to make, or to just gather opinions. Users can choose to make a profile so that they can store their polls or enter as guest and have their polls be anonymous. It has a feed where everyone can view every poll posted ever and users can delete, share, and browse past polls.
